#ATM Machine Application

## Description
This project is a Java-based ATM Machine application developed as part of my internship at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd in January 2025. The project simulates the basic functionalities of an ATM machine, like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, viewing transaction history and exiting.It also includes features like PIN validation and daily withdrawal limits to make the application more practical. I created this project using my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
