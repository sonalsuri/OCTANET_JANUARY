# OctaNet_January Projects Repository
Welcome to the OctaNet_January repository! This repository contains all the projects assigned to me as part of my internship with OctaNet. Every week, I am given a new project to work on, and each project is stored in its own folder.

## Folder Structure
Each project is stored in a separate folder under the Web_Development_Project/ and Java_Project/ (or other categories, if applicable). Inside each project folder, you will find the relevant files (HTML, CSS, JS for web development, Java files for Java-related tasks, etc.) for that specific project.

# Projects Overview
## Web Development Projects
These projects involve working on various web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The folder Web_Development_Project/ contains all the web projects organized by the project name.

## Java Projects
This folder contains projects related to Java programming. Each project focuses on different aspects of Java development.

# How to Navigate the Projects

## Web Development Projects:
Go to the folder Web_Development_Project/.
Each project folder inside this will have the respective files (HTML, CSS, JS) for that project.
Example: Web_Development_Project/Project_1/, Web_Development_Project/Project_2/, etc.

## Java Projects:
Go to the folder Java_Project/.
Each Java project will have the necessary files for the specific task.
Example: Java_Project/ATM_Machine/, Java_Project/Project_X/, etc.
How to Run/Use the Projects
For each project, follow the below instructions to set it up and run it:

## Web Development Projects:
Open the HTML file (usually index.html) in any browser to view the project.
You can also modify the CSS and JS files to customize the project further.

## Java Projects:
Import the Java files into your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
Run the Java program using the IDE's built-in features.

# Upcoming Projects
Each week, a new project will be added here. Stay tuned for the weekly updates!
